# Source Devanagari Sans

Source Devanagari Sans currently exists as a set of incomplete, preliminary design masters (UFOs) and some supplementary files to demonstrate some basic project setup parameters for a typical Devanagari font project. One of the first important considerations in beginning such a project would be to define the scope of the project. The [GlyphOrderAndAliasDB](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-devanagari-sans/blob/master/GlyphOrderAndAliasDB) is a document that lists all of the glyphs that will go into a final font. This document is in two column, tab delimited format with the final glyph names in the first column, followed by the production glyph names in the second. There is also a corresponding [family.fea](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-devanagari-sans/blob/master/family.fea) document, which defines the OpenType features for the glyph set outlined by the GOADB.

While we hope that this project will someday become a full-fledged typeface family, this is not currently in active development. However, should you like to help this become a reality, or if you have questions about these resources, please contact the project developer, [Paul D. Hunt](mailto:opensourcefonts@adobe.com?subject=[GitHub] Source Devanagari Sans).
