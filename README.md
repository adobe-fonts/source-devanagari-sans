# Source Devanagari Sans

Source Devanagari Sans currently exists as a set of incomplete, preliminary design masters (UFOs) and some supplementary files to demonstrate a typical glyph complement for a Devanagari font [GlyphOrderAndAliasDB](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-devanagari-sans/blob/master/GlyphOrderAndAliasDB) together with OpenType code that correspond to the given glyph complement [family.fea](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-devanagari-sans/blob/master/family.fea). While we hope that this project will someday become a full-fledged typeface family, this is not currently in active development. However, should you like to help this become a reality, please contact the project developer as described in the Getting Involved section directly below.

## Getting Involved

Send suggestions for changes to the Source Devanagari Sans OpenType font project maintainer, [Paul D. Hunt](mailto:opensourcefonts@adobe.com?subject=[GitHub] Source Devanagari Sans), for consideration.

## Further information

For information about the design and background of the parent project, Source Sans Pro, please refer to the [official font readme file](https://rawgit.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro/master/SourceSansProReadMe.html).
